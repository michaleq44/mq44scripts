# just my linux shell scripts to make my life easier
## Make sure you have `XDG_SESSION_TYPE` and `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` set somewhere
## Modify the scripts to your liking

## Errors
if you're getting errors make sure to read the comments on top of the files.
many of my scripts use XDG in some way but you can substitute that easily
to use another shell change the shebang (the `#!/usr/bin/bash`)
